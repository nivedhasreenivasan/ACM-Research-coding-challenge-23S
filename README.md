# ACM Research coding challenge (Spring 2023)


## Problem

The code written aims to predict whether a star in the data set belongs to a specific star type through testing if its magnitude, spectral class, and temperature fall within the accepted range of the star type. In other words, the program calculates star type based on the same parameters used in the hertzsprung-russell diagram to make its prediction.
