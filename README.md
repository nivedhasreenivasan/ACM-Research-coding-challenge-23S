# ACM Research coding challenge (Spring 2023)


## Problem

The code written aims to predict wheather a star in the data set belongs to a specific star type through testing if the star's magintude, spectral class, and temperature fall within the accepted range of the star type. The program then tests the accuracy of the formula by comparing the results with the given star type in the data set for each star.
